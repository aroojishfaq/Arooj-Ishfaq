        <strong>What is a paragraph?</strong>
        <p>
         A paragraph is a series of related sentences developing a central idea, called the topic.
         Try to think about paragraphs in terms of thematic unity: a paragraph is a sentence or a group of sentences that supports one central,
        unified idea. Paragraphs add one idea at a time to your broader argument.
</p>
        <strong>Do I unify my ideas in a paragraph?</strong> 
        <p>
          Probably the most effective way to achieve paragraph unity is to express the central idea of the paragraph in a topic sentence.
</p>

  <strong>  How long should a paragraph be?</strong>
  <p>
Paragraphs vary in length depending on the needs of the paragraph. Usually, paragraphs are between 
one-third and two-thirds of a page double spaced.
A series of long paragraphs can make prose dense and unpleasant to read. Check any paragraph that is a page or longer
 to see whether it would work better as two or more paragraphs. Break it at a logical place (e.g., where your focus shifts), 
 and see whether you need to create new topic sentences to make the shift clear.
Also look out for short paragraphs only two or three sentences long. They make 
academic writing seem disjointed or skimpy. Try combining short paragraphs with the preceding or following paragraph 
if they share the same topic. Short paragraphs might also need to be developed further. Make sure that nothing vital has been omitted.
